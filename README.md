# Hiroyuki Sawano Bullet Hell

The inspiration for this project is through bullet-hell style games. The primary interest in this project is built as a way to experiment and simplify bullet patterns representation in OpenGL games which ended up being a bit more tricky than expected.

As a huge Hiroyuki Sawano fan, naturally I chose his music, namely [Boukyaku Keikoku](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKnCRtYyxSk) and [Be2Arr1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpoHuwOoEd0). Player functions as Reimu (Touhou) and is just expected to dodge bullets from Ino (Naruto). 

* Player dies by getting hit by bullets.
* Win condition is through surviving until a You Win text shows up on the screen.
* Player can shoot if has power through the V key. Player moves using arrow keys.
